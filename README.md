## Correctness

Strive to make your code compile without warnings.

## Using SwiftLint

See the [SwiftLint Policy](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide/blob/master/SWIFTLINT.markdown) for more information.

## Naming

Descriptive and consistent naming makes software easier to read and understand. Use the Swift naming conventions described in the [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/). Some key takeaways include:

- prioritizing clarity over brevity
- using `camelCase` (not `snake_case`)
- using `UpperCamelCase` for types and protocols, `lowerCamelCase` for everything else
- including all needed words while omitting needless words
- using names based on roles, not types
- using terms that don't surprise experts or confuse beginners
- generally avoiding abbreviations
- preferring methods and properties to free functions
- casing acronyms and initialisms uniformly up or down
- giving the same base name to methods that share the same meaning

### Use Type Inferred Context

Use compiler inferred context to write shorter, clear code.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let selector = #selector(viewDidLoad)
view.backgroundColor = .red
let toView = context.view(forKey: .to)
let view = UIView(frame: .zero)
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let selector = #selector(ViewController.viewDidLoad)
view.backgroundColor = UIColor.red
let toView = context.view(forKey: UITransitionContextViewKey.to)
let view = UIView(frame: CGRect.zero)
```

### Language

Use US English spelling to match Apple's API.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let color = "red"
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let colour = "red"
```

## Code Organization

Use extensions to organize your code into logical blocks of functionality. Each extension should be set off with a `// MARK: -` comment to keep things well-organized.

### Protocol Conformance

In particular, when adding protocol conformance to a model, prefer adding a separate extension for the protocol methods. This keeps the related methods grouped together with the protocol and can simplify instructions to add a protocol to a class with its associated methods.

**Preferred**:
```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
  // class stuff here
}

// MARK: - UITableViewDataSource
extension MyViewController: UITableViewDataSource {
  // table view data source methods
}

// MARK: - UIScrollViewDelegate
extension MyViewController: UIScrollViewDelegate {
  // scroll view delegate methods
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UIScrollViewDelegate {
  // all methods
}
```

### Unused Code

Unused (dead) code, including Xcode template code and placeholder comments should be removed. This includes any empty/unused UIApplicationDelegate methods.

**Preferred**:
```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  return Database.contacts.count
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
  super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
  // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
}

override func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
  // #warning Incomplete implementation, return the number of sections
  return 1
}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  // #warning Incomplete implementation, return the number of rows
  return Database.contacts.count
}

```
### Minimal Imports

Import only the modules a source file requires. For example, don't import `UIKit` when importing `Foundation` will suffice. Likewise, don't import `Foundation` if you must import `UIKit`.

**Preferred**:
```
import UIKit

var view: UIView
var deviceModels: [String]
```

**Preferred**:
```
import Foundation

var deviceModels: [String]
```

**Not Preferred**:
```
import UIKit
import Foundation

var view: UIView
var deviceModels: [String]
```

**Not Preferred**:
```
import UIKit

var deviceModels: [String]
```

## Spacing

* Indent 4 wrapped lines by 4 spaces.

* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
* Tip: You can re-indent by selecting some code (or **Command-A** to select all) and then **Control-I** (or **Editor ▸ Structure ▸ Re-Indent** in the menu).

**Preferred**:
```swift
if user.isHappy {
  // Do something
} else {
  // Do something else
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
if user.isHappy
{
  // Do something
}
else {
  // Do something else
}
```

* There should be one blank line between methods and up to one blank line between type declarations to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into several methods.

* There should be no blank lines after an opening brace or before a closing brace.

* Colons always have no space on the left and one space on the right. Exceptions are the ternary operator `? :`, empty dictionary `[:]` and `#selector` syntax `addTarget(_:action:)`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
class TestDatabase: Database {
  var data: [String: CGFloat] = ["A": 1.2, "B": 3.2]
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
class TestDatabase : Database {
  var data :[String:CGFloat] = ["A" : 1.2, "B":3.2]
}
```

* Avoid trailing whitespaces at the ends of lines.

* Add a single newline character at the end of each file.

## Comments

When they are needed, use comments to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Comments must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Avoid block comments inline with code, as the code should be as self-documenting as possible. _Exception: This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation._

Avoid the use of C-style comments (`/* ... */`). Prefer the use of double- or triple-slash.

## Function Declarations

Keep short function declarations on one line including the opening brace:

```swift
func reticulateSplines(spline: [Double]) -> Bool {
  // reticulate code goes here
}
```

For functions with long signatures, put each parameter on a new line and add an extra indent on subsequent lines:

```swift
func reticulateSplines(
  spline: [Double], 
  adjustmentFactor: Double,
  translateConstant: Int, 
  comment: String
) -> Bool {
  // reticulate code goes here
}
```

Don't use `(Void)` to represent the lack of an input; simply use `()`. Use `Void` instead of `()` for closure and function outputs.

**Preferred**:

```swift
func updateConstraints() -> Void {
  // magic happens here
}

typealias CompletionHandler = (result) -> Void
```

**Not Preferred**:

```swift
func updateConstraints() -> () {
  // magic happens here
}

typealias CompletionHandler = (result) -> ()
```

## Function Calls

Mirror the style of function declarations at call sites. Calls that fit on a single line should be written as such:

```swift
let success = reticulateSplines(splines)
```

If the call site must be wrapped, put each parameter on a new line, indented one additional level:

```swift
let success = reticulateSplines(
  spline: splines,
  adjustmentFactor: 1.3,
  translateConstant: 2,
  comment: "normalize the display")
```

## Closure Expressions

Use trailing closure syntax only if there's a single closure expression parameter at the end of the argument list. Give the closure parameters descriptive names.

**Preferred**:
```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0) {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}

UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}, completion: { finished in
  self.myView.removeFromSuperview()
})
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
})

UIView.animate(withDuration: 1.0, animations: {
  self.myView.alpha = 0
}) { f in
  self.myView.removeFromSuperview()
}
```

For single-expression closures where the context is clear, use implicit returns:

```swift
attendeeList.sort { a, b in
  a > b
}
```

## Types

Always use Swift's native types and expressions when available. Swift offers bridging to Objective-C so you can still use the full set of methods as needed.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = "\(width)"                         // String
```

**Less Preferred**:
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = (width as NSNumber).stringValue    // String
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let width: NSNumber = 120.0                          // NSNumber
let widthString: NSString = width.stringValue        // NSString
```

In drawing code, use `CGFloat` if it makes the code more succinct by avoiding too many conversions.

### Constants

Constants are defined using the `let` keyword and variables with the `var` keyword. Always use `let` instead of `var` if the value of the variable will not change.

**Tip:** A good technique is to define everything using `let` and only change it to `var` if the compiler complains!

You can define constants on a type rather than on an instance of that type using type properties. To declare a type property as a constant simply use `static let`. Example:

**Preferred**:
```swift
enum Math {
  static let e = 2.718281828459045235360287
  static let root2 = 1.41421356237309504880168872
}

let hypotenuse = side * Math.root2

```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let e = 2.718281828459045235360287  // pollutes global namespace
let root2 = 1.41421356237309504880168872

let hypotenuse = side * root2 // what is root2?
```

### Optionals

Declare variables and function return types as optional with `?` where a `nil` value is acceptable.

Use implicitly unwrapped types declared with `!` only for instance variables that you know will be initialized later before use, such as subviews that will be set up in `viewDidLoad()`. Prefer optional binding to implicitly unwrapped optionals in most other cases.

When accessing an optional value, use optional chaining if the value is only accessed once or if there are many optionals in the chain:

```swift
textContainer?.textLabel?.setNeedsDisplay()
```

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations:

```swift
if let textContainer = textContainer {
  // do many things with textContainer
}
```

When naming optional variables and properties, avoid naming them like `optionalString` or `maybeView` since their optional-ness is already in the type declaration.

For optional binding, shadow the original name whenever possible rather than using names like `unwrappedView` or `actualLabel`.

**Preferred**:
```swift
var subview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

// later on...
if let subview = subview, let volume = volume {
  // do something with unwrapped subview and volume
}

// another example
resource.request().onComplete { [weak self] response in
  guard let self = self else { 
    return 
  }
  let model = self.updateModel(response)
  self.updateUI(model)
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var optionalSubview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

if let unwrappedSubview = optionalSubview {
  if let realVolume = volume {
    // do something with unwrappedSubview and realVolume
  }
}

// another example
UIView.animate(withDuration: 2.0) { [weak self] in
  guard let strongSelf = self else { 
    return 
  }
  strongSelf.alpha = 1.0
}
```

### Type Inference

Prefer compact code and let the compiler infer the type for constants or variables of single instances.

**Preferred**:
```swift
let message = "Hello Viettel Digital"
let currentBounds = computeViewBounds()
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
let message: String = "Hello Viettel Digital"
let currentBounds: CGRect = computeViewBounds()
```

#### Type Annotation for Empty Arrays and Dictionaries

For empty arrays and dictionaries, use type annotation. (For an array or dictionary assigned to a large, multi-line literal, use type annotation.)

**Preferred**:
```swift
var names: [String] = []
var lookup: [String: Int] = [:]
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var names = [String]()
var lookup = [String: Int]()
```

**NOTE**: Following this guideline means picking descriptive names is even more important than before.


### Syntactic Sugar

Prefer the shortcut versions of type declarations over the full generics syntax.

**Preferred**:
```swift
var deviceModels: [String]
var employees: [Int: String]
var phoneNumber: Int?
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
var deviceModels: Array<String>
var employees: Dictionary<Int, String>
var phoneNumber: Optional<Int>
```
